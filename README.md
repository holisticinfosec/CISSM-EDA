### Exploratory Data Analysis - University of Maryland CISSM Cyber Attacks Database  
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a mission critical task underpinning the predominance of detection development and preparation for cybersecurity-centric machine learning.  
There are a number of actions that analysts can take to better understand a particular data set and ready it for more robust utilization. In the spirit of [toolsmith](https://holisticinfosec.io/page/toolsmith/), and celebration of this being the 150th issue since toolsmith's inception in late 2006, consider what follows a collection of tools for your security data analytics tool kit.   
The University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies (CISSM) [Cyber Attacks Database](https://cissm.liquifiedapps.com/) is an ideal candidate for experimental exploration. Per the dataset [description](https://cissm.liquifiedapps.com/#about), the database "brings together open-source information surrounding a range of publicly acknowledged cyber events on private and public organizations. Events from 2014 through present have been coded to standardize information on threat actor, threat actor country, motive, target, end effects, industry, and country of impact. Source links to the news source are also provided" (Harry & Gallagher, 2018).   
The project's principal investigators provided data export access as the default UI content is not suited to raw ingestion. The resulting *cissm-export.csv* (through MAR 2023) file, and all of the code discussed [here](https://holisticinfosec.io/post/eda-cissm-cad), as well as a Jupyter/Colab notebook for convenient experimentation, are included in this repository.
